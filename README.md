# Bachelor's project
Gravitational lensing is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to the inhomogeneous gravitational field in which the light rays from these galaxies propagate. Depending on the magnitude of the distortion we can consider two lensing regimes: strong and weak lensing. The latter was the topic of focus of my Bachelor's thesis.
